# Simple Proxy

Very simple proxy for running stuff on a local port.

### Usage

Requires deno to be installed on your system

`deno run -A https://raw.githubcontent.com/seanaye/simple-proxy/mod.ts --to [SOME_URL] --port [LOCAL_PORT_NUMBER]`

### Why is this useful

I made this because I did not have permission to change a callback url off of localhost:80 and I didnt want to bother with changing ASP .NET configs off of port 8080. 

It may or may not be useful outside of this application
